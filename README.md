# Project Information
Implement a cutting edge path planning technique from literature published later than 2018. The path planning we chose is called PPRO RRT. This technique is implemented with a custom made obstacle space as well as in a different 3-D obstacle space. We are testing this technique's speed and cost versus the A* algorithm.
