# Project Information
Implement a cutting edge path planning technique from literature published later than 2018. The path planning we chose is called PPRO RRT. This technique is implemented with a custom made obstacle space as well as in a different 3-D obstacle space. We are testing this technique's speed and cost versus the A* algorithm. The paper can be found here:

# Important Notes Please Read:
1. Videos of certain outputs can be seen here, since I cannot upload large files to GitHub:
2. If you have not read the report yet (in this repository), I highly suggest you do, as the findings from this project state that more research and work has to be done to make this path planning algorithm work with a differential drive robot.
